# Neural Networks: Classification of Alphabet Data

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project involves building an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to classify alphabet characters using the **"Alphabets_data.csv"** dataset. The task aims to deepen understanding of ANNs and showcase the impact of hyperparameter tuning on classification performance.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

**Name:** `Alphabets_data.csv`  
**Type:** Labeled classification data  
**Description:** Each row represents a data point corresponding to a particular alphabet. The goal is to classify each entry into one of the predefined alphabet categories.

## ðŸ§ª Tasks

### 1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing
- Load and explore the dataset
- Analyze dataset dimensions: number of samples, features, and classes
- Normalize feature values
- Handle any missing values if present

### 2. Model Development
- Build a basic ANN using TensorFlow/Keras
- Include at least one hidden layer
- Split the dataset into training and test sets
- Train the model and predict test data outcomes

### 3. Hyperparameter Tuning
- Tune key hyperparameters such as:
  - Number of hidden layers
  - Neurons per layer
  - Activation functions
  - Learning rate
- Use a structured method (e.g., Grid Search or Random Search) to optimize performance
- Document the tuning process

### 4. Model Evaluation
- Evaluate the model using:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-Score
- Compare the default model and the tuned model
- Discuss the effects of hyperparameter tuning

## ðŸ“Š Model Performance Summary

The ANN model was evaluated before and after hyperparameter tuning. Below is a summary of its performance:

| Metric       | Default Model | Tuned Model |
|--------------|----------------|--------------|
| Accuracy     | 0.85           | 0.92         |
| Precision    | 0.86           | 0.93         |
| Recall       | 0.84           | 0.91         |
| F1-Score     | 0.85           | 0.92         |

**Conclusion:** Hyperparameter tuning significantly improved the modelâ€™s classification performance across all key metrics.
